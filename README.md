Crack Detection using MATLAB: Developed an image processing algorithm to detect surface cracks on concrete structures. Used preprocessing, noise filtering, edge detection, and morphological operations to segment crack regions and visualize results. Applicable for structural health monitoring and damage analysis.
# Crack Detection using MATLAB

This project detects cracks on concrete surfaces using MATLAB image processing techniques.

## Methods used
- Grayscale conversion
- Gaussian filtering
- Edge detection (Canny)
- Morphological operations
- Crack segmentation

## How to run
1. Open MATLAB
2. Run main.m
3. Select image input

## Output
The program highlights crack regions and calculates crack length.
